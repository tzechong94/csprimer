"""
Implement the following functions, using recursion.

If you find it easier to use iteration, do that first! Then, rewrite it recursively :)

If the recursive approach seems obvious, try to also write it iteratively. Seeing
the connection between the two is highly worthwhile.

This is just for practice. In reality, most or all of these would be solved well enough
or better with iteration. But by getting some extra reps on easier problems, we'll
be better prepared for harder problems where recursion is a good fit.

    Determine the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b. One approach is

    - Repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger one, until no longer possible
    - If the remainder is zero, then the smaller number must be the GCD
    - Otherwise, repeat the process, using the number you were subtracting as the new "larger"
        number, and the remainder as the new "smaller" number

    For example if a = 1071 and b = 462 (taken from Wikipedia):

    - Subtracting 462 twice from 1071 leaves a remainder of 147
    - Subtracting 147 three times from 462 leaves a remainder of 21
    - Subtracting 21 seven times from 147 leaves a remainder of 0

    So, 21 divides both 147 and 462, and is the greatest number to do this.
