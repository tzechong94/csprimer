# Algo and data structures

## How to solve it by Polya

1. understand the problem
   1. heuristics
      1. draw a figure
      2. be systematic
      3. is this similar to a solved problem
      4. induction -> generalise from specific cases
      5. decomposing/recomposing
      6. sovle an easier problem (auxilliary problem)
      7. definition
2. devise a plan
3. implement the plan
4. reflect/revise

Benefits and pitfalls of asymptotic analysis

hazards:

- constant factors may matter
- n is often small
- maintenance cost
- space is time

pros:

- system agnostic understanding of algo

## Building an intuition for common running times

1. constant ish -> perfect
2. linear ish -> straightforward
3. polynomial ish -> doable, maybe tricky
   1. n^2 more than 10000 is very huge.
4. exponential ish -> impossible
   1. 100 and above is impossible.

2^100 can't be computed. too huge
