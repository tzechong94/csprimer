# Plan

- strategy: use chaining
- hashup is array of N linked list
- LL nodes will have key, value, hash of key, next (to access next item)

out of scope: "TODO"

- resize as we get a lot of collisions
- fancy features
- non-string keys

action plan:

- implement a hash function
- implement get/set/delete assuming no collisions
- handle collisions
- refactor, handle TODOs
