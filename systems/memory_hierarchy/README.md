Cache line

- a notional unit of memory that is automatically pulled into a cache on the CPU itself, whenever a value on that line is accessed. This is because main memory access on a modern machine can take 50-100ns, compared to 1ns for the closest level of cache, or a fraction of nanosecond to perform most basic operations.

ram latency hasn't improved much, although compute has improved a lot.
